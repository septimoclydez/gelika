Dito na sa'n ka na
Dito na sa paraiso
Nand'yan ka ba oh sinta
Maari ba tayong magkita na (ah)
Alam mo bang naghihintay
Gustong malagyan ng kulay
Dito ka sa aking tabi
Hinding-hindi ka itatanggi
Ikaw lang ang tinatangi alam mo sana iyan
Hindi ko alam ang sasabihin
Ikaw lang ang aking iibigin
Hindi ka pababayaan
Sinta
Lumulubog ang araw ng wala ka
Oras ng pag-iibigan natin ay wala ba
Sana magkita-kita kahit na saglit
Sa tagpuan nating laging waglit

I just want to take a moment to appreciate you, not just for what you bring into my life, but for who you are. Your presence is like a calm in a storm, even if you don’t always see that in yourself. I see it. I feel it. And I’m grateful for it.

I know things between us are not exactly defined. We’re somewhere in between, and that’s okay. I don’t need a label to feel something real. I don’t need a title to appreciate you. I’m not here to push or pressure or make you feel like you have to give more than you’re ready to. That’s not love. That’s not care. And I care about you, deeply.

I really feel like you should know how much I appreciate you.

I guess this is just my own way of celebrating you the girl who’s quietly and unexpectedly become one of the best parts of my life.

You might not even realize how much you’ve affected me. But I do. Every single day.

You’re honestly so beautiful, in this quiet and natural way that’s hard to explain. It’s not just how you look, but how you are. It’s in your smile, your eyes, the way you care about stuff even when no one’s paying attention. The way you remember the small things I say. The way you check in on me. The way you’re just thoughtful, even when you don’t try. It just comes naturally with you. And that’s rare.

There’s something soft and calming about you. Like, just being around you makes things feel a little lighter, a little safer. The world can be so loud and stressful sometimes, but when you’re around, everything feels a bit more okay.

I never expected any of this. I never expected you. But I’m really glad you came into my life, even if we don’t have any labels or clear direction.

I know we’re not calling each other anything. We’re not official or anything like that. And that’s fine. I’m not here to rush or pressure anything. I just want to be honest with you. And the truth is... you matter to me. Probably more than I show sometimes.

You’ve become someone really important to me.

You’re not mine. But somehow, you still feel like home. And I think that’s what this whole thing is really about.

I just want to say thank you. For being who you are. For being soft and kind and thoughtful. For making me laugh, for showing up, even in small ways. For every little moment that probably didn’t seem like a big deal to you — but meant a lot to me.

So tomorrow, even if I can’t call you “my girlfriend,” I still want to celebrate you. Appreciate you. The best way I know how just by telling you honestly how much you mean to me.

You’re not just pretty. You’re not just sweet. You’re not just kind.

You’re this quiet light the kind that doesn’t need to shine too bright to be noticed, but somehow makes everything around it feel warmer.

And I really hope someone tells you tomorrow how amazing you are. But if not, let this message be that reminder.

You’re appreciated.
You’re admired.
And you’ve become someone I care about in a way I didn’t expect.

So here’s to National Girlfriend Day.
From someone who isn’t your boyfriend but thinks you’re absolutely one of a kind.
With all the honesty I’ve got.


PLACEHOLDER-
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
